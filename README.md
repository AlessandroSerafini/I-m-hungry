This project is developed by Alessandro Serafini (N.283058) for the final exam of the course of PIATTAFORME DIGITALI PER LA GESTIONE DEL TERRITORIO - A.A. 2018/2019

## About 

Find the best restaurants uploaded by users, based on criteria such as name and kind of food. You can consult data sheets and customer ratings about your favorite restaurant.

## Web client
The [web client](https://github.com/AlessandroSerafini/I-m-hungry-frontend) allows you to consult the restaurants added by users through the use of a Google Map.

In addition to the map, a login panel is available: once authenticated it will be possible to handle restaurants entered by users, by adding them, modifying them or removing them.

## Telegram Bot
You can also add, edit and delete restaurants using [Telegram bot](https://t.me/AleSerafiniBot) to keep the community alive!
