The [web client](https://github.com/AlessandroSerafini/I-m-hungry-frontend) ([here the demo](https://uniurb.firebaseapp.com/)) allows you to consult the restaurants added by users through the use of a Google Map.

In addition to the map, a login panel is available: once authenticated it will be possible to handle restaurants entered by users, by adding them, modifying them or removing them.

## Telegram Bot
You can also add, edit and delete restaurants using [Telegram bot](https://t.me/AleSerafiniBot) to keep the community alive!
